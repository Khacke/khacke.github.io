Hello, I've decided to create this website/blog for two main reasons:
- To catalog my journey, so i can look back at it anytime i want
- Maybe someone will find something interesting in here

This post is in english, but there may be/will be posts in hungarian as well, as it is my native language.

I've tried Jekyll as it is supported by github pages by default, but I didn't like it at all so i decided to use Hugo. As of now I'm happy with this decission.

You can leave comment bellow posts thanks to giscus. I'm too broke to use something like Disqus, and i wanted to use cactus comments but they don't work as of now.
But I'm happy with giscus.

What to expect here?
- Mostly stuff related to programming and data engineering
- But I will make posts about anything I find interesting

Stay safe.
